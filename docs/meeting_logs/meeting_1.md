# D&D Campaign generator:

Is it a one time generator, or a throughout the campaign

What is a DND campaign?:

What are the existing solutions?

What does a polished product look and feel like?

What is an appropriate scope for the time frame?

What is the appropriate group size to work in?

Toolkit idea:

Puzzle generator, trap generator, room generator, item generator, map generator, monster generator, combat generator, event/encounter generator, character generator.

Ensuring our scope is small from the beginning is important. We need to limit interactions and content during prototyping to ensure that we can get the fundamentals down before we start to come up with new ideas for content.

Dynamic campaign generation can be defined on many factors, a railroaded campaign requires more scaling and finetuned experiences. Dungeon crawls can be more open ended and more player-centric.
