## Mitigation Strategies:

| # | Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Impact on Access to Laboratories and Equipment | Maintain active use of online resources for communication and productivity until access to laboratories and equipment is restored. |
| 2 | Compatibility Issues with Services or Equipment | Research and prepare alternative services and equipment options in case of incompatibility or unavailability. |
| 3 | Scope Creep Leading to Minimum Requirement Challenges | Focus on fulfilling minimum requirements before considering any additional features, potentially reallocating resources. |
| 4 | Team Member Availability | Distribute absent members' tasks evenly among the remaining team to maintain workflow and prevent overload. |
| 5 | Customer Sickness | If the client is sick, reschedule meetings or discussions as needed, and consider adjusting project timelines if necessary. |
| 6 | Customer-Requested Requirement Alterations | If new requirements are not feasible within the remaining timeframe, consider declining or negotiating them with the client. |
| 7 | Alignment of Products with Stakeholder Expectations | Hold regular client meetings to ensure features align with specifications, enhancing clarity and preventing misunderstandings. |
| 8 | Communication Gaps Among Team and Stakeholders | Conduct frequent team meetings and utilize communication platforms to ensure everyone is informed and on track. |
| 9 | Functional Impact Due to Undetected Bugs | Implement testing procedures for each function to identify and address bugs before proceeding to new tasks. |
| 10 | Insufficient Team Skillset | Organize skill-building sessions led by knowledgeable team members to elevate everyone's expertise and contribution. |
| 11 | Interpersonal Conflict | Address conflicts openly and encourage a positive team environment. Establish effective communication channels to resolve disputes. |
| 12 | Underperforming Team Member | Identify areas of underperformance early and provide additional support, guidance, or reassignment of tasks as needed. |
| 13 | Deviations from Established Procedures | Enforce adherence to established procedures and provide training to prevent deviation. |
| 14 | Faulty Hardware | Have backup hardware available and establish protocols for addressing technical failures swiftly. |
| 15 | Group Member Drops Out | Develop contingency plans and allocate tasks to remaining team members to mitigate the impact of a dropout. |
| 16 | GitLab Disruption | Regularly back up code and collaborate via alternative platforms in case of GitLab disruptions. |
| 17 | Misuse of Version Control | Implement strict access controls, code review practices, and regular training to prevent unauthorized or improper use of version control systems. |
