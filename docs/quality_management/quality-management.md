# Quality Assurance and Control Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the quality assurance and control practices to be followed throughout the development of the project. The aim is to ensure the delivery of a high-quality and DND map generator that meets the specified requirements.

## 2. Linting

### 2.1 Purpose

Linting is a critical practice that ensures consistent code formatting and adherence to coding standards. It helps maintain code readability and reduces the likelihood of errors.

### 2.2 Approach

- A linting tool will be integrated into the development environment to analyze code for formatting and style issues.
- Linting rules and configurations will be defined in a shared configuration file to ensure uniformity across the codebase.
- Developers will be required to run the linting tool before submitting code for review.

## 3. Unit Testing

### 3.1 Purpose

Unit testing verifies the correctness of individual code units, ensuring that they function as intended in isolation.

### 3.2 Approach

- Developers will write unit tests for each functional unit of code, covering different scenarios and edge cases.
- A testing framework (e.g., Jest, NUnit) will be used to automate the execution of unit tests.
- Unit tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that new code changes do not break existing functionality.

## 4. Pipeline

### 4.1 Purpose

The pipeline ensures automated building, testing, and deployment of code changes. It enables continuous integration and delivery, enhancing code quality and project efficiency.

### 4.2 Approach

- A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline will be established using a CI/CD platform (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD).
- The pipeline will be configured to:
  - Build the codebase upon each commit.
  - Run automated tests, including unit tests and integration tests.
  - Perform code quality checks, such as linting and code coverage analysis.
  - Deploy the application to staging environments for further testing.
  - Deploy to production upon successful testing in staging environments.

## 5. Review Strategy

### 5.1 Purpose

The review strategy ensures thorough and comprehensive code reviews before changes are merged into the main branch. This helps identify issues early and maintain code quality.

### 5.2 Approach

- **Pre-Review Preparation:**
  - Developers will complete their tasks and ensure that code is properly documented and adheres to coding standards.
  - The linting tool will be run to fix any formatting or style issues.
  - Unit tests will be written to cover new code changes.

- **Comprehensive Code Reviews:**
  - Before pushing code changes to the main branch, developers will create merge requests (MRs) that include detailed descriptions of their changes.
  - The MRs will be assigned to designated reviewers, who will conduct comprehensive reviews.
  - Reviewers will assess code quality, logic, adherence to requirements, and potential risks.
  - Automated testing results, including test coverage reports, will be analyzed to identify areas of concern.

- **Feedback and Iteration:**
  - Reviewers will provide constructive feedback and request necessary changes.
  - Developers will address the feedback, update the code, and engage in discussions if needed.
  - Code revisions will be pushed to the PR, triggering automated testing and another round of review if necessary.

- **Merge to Main:**
  - Once the code is approved by reviewers and passes all automated tests, it will be merged into the main branch.

## 6. Conclusion

This Quality Assurance and Control Document outlines the linting, unit testing, pipeline, and review strategy practices to ensure the development of a high-quality software solution. Following these practices will contribute to the reliability, maintainability, and overall success of the project.
