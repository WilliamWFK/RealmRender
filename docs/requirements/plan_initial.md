# Plan for getting the project started
**Questions for Client:**

By "world builder" do you mean to generate the Map i.e the land that would be played on or? Question below.

Answer: random map gen YES

Would you like it to be more of a dungeon master tool kit: e.g a bunch of generators for different mob types, item types, puzzles, traps & encounters:,would you like a general campaign idea with everything generated for the normal start of a DND campaign played in person, or would you like an entire one shot adventure generated?

Would you like to have a campaign generated throughout the gameplay, or all upfront at the start, and what aspects would you like generated upfront?

Would you like it to be a dungeon crawl adventure or an open world adventure?

Dungeon crawling can include a goal, traps and treasure to find scattered around an either procedurally generated dungeon or a hand-crafted one.

Would you like it developed as a web application or an executable application?

Would you like to have a difficulty scale?

Map ready to play.

Player view(semi blind) and a dm view.

Not too much time of the visuals(unless you can)

SPEND the 900 hours (15hrs x 10wks x 6ppl)

Table-Top map generator

Narrative around the map(Thematically relevant, rooms have a narrative component, things are logically reasonable narratively)

MVP generates map, stretch goals assist in storytelling & gameplay

He does not care ðŸ˜Ž what we make (mostly)

R E A C T

Logic behind the map i.e the narrative can be maybe preset? (trie-structure for logic)
